# Conclusion

This analysis delves into the intricate interplay of environmental, behavioral, and socioeconomic factors that significantly influence life expectancy across the globe. By leveraging the WHO Global Health Observatory (GHO) dataset, we observed that air pollution, water quality, smoking, alcohol consumption, and access to healthcare are key determinants of health outcomes. While high-income countries generally enjoy longer life expectancies due to advanced healthcare systems and economic prosperity, disparities persist within and between countries. To gain deeper insights into country-specific trends, we developed an interactive D3.js visualization tool that allows users to select specific countries of interest and conduct time series analyses. However, it's important to note that country-specific factors, such as political instability, conflict, and historical events, can significantly influence health outcomes and life expectancy, and may not be fully captured by the factors explored in this analysis. Further research is needed to identify and understand these additional factors and their impact on global health disparities. A key lesson learned from this analysis is the critical importance of robust data preparation and cleaning. The complexity of the WHO Global Health Observatory (GHO) dataset, with its numerous countries, indicators, and dimensions, highlighted the significant time and effort required to transform raw data into a usable format for exploratory data analysis and visualization. This experience underscores the need for efficient data management techniques and tools, such as missing value analysis, data filtering, merging and joining for integration, data reshaping and aggregation for analysis, and data visualization libraries (e.g., ggplot2) for insights. By effectively utilizing these tools and techniques, researchers can streamline the data preparation process, accelerate analysis, and generate more accurate and reliable findings.
