# Conclusion

This analysis delves into the intricate interplay of environmental, behavioral, and socioeconomic factors that significantly influence life expectancy across the globe. By leveraging the WHO Global Health Observatory (GHO) dataset, we observed that air pollution, water quality, smoking, alcohol consumption, and access to healthcare are key determinants of health outcomes. While high-income countries generally enjoy longer life expectancies due to advanced healthcare systems and economic prosperity, disparities persist within and between countries. To gain deeper insights into country-specific trends, we developed an interactive D3.js visualization tool that allows users to select specific countries of interest and conduct time series analyses. However, itâ€™s important to note that country-specific factors, such as political instability, conflict, and historical events, can significantly influence the life expectancy and may not be fully captured by the factors explored in this analysis.To fully understand the disparities related to the average life expectancy across countries, the further research is needed to identify and understand the additional factors, such as country specific factors, and  and their impact on global health disparities. For country-specific factors, political instability, conflict, and historical events play a critical role in shaping health outcomes and life expectancy, often beyond what can be captured by conventional analyses. Political instability disrupts healthcare systems, limiting access to essential medical services, medications, and qualified professionals, as governments often prioritize defense and conflict resolution over public health. Armed conflicts exacerbate this by directly reducing life expectancy through casualties and injuries while displacing millions into refugee camps with inadequate sanitation, nutrition, and healthcare access. These regions often face long-term challenges, including residual violence, landmine injuries, and fractured healthcare infrastructure, delaying recovery even after conflicts subside. Additionally, cultural practices, such as early marriages or female genital mutilation, can adversely impact health outcomes, particularly for women and children. Gender inequality and limited access to education further exacerbate these issues, as they reduce awareness of essential health practices and restrict access to healthcare. A key lesson learned from this analysis is the critical importance of robust data preparation and cleaning. The complexity of the WHO Global Health Observatory (GHO) dataset, with its numerous countries, indicators, and dimensions, highlighted the significant time and effort required to transform raw data into a usable format for exploratory data analysis and visualization. This experience underscores the need for efficient data management techniques and tools, such as missing value analysis, data filtering, merging and joining for integration, data reshaping and aggregation for analysis, and data visualization libraries (e.g., ggplot2) for insights. By effectively utilizing these tools and techniques, researchers can streamline the data preparation process, accelerate analysis, and generate more accurate and reliable findings.
