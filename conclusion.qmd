# Conclusion

This analysis explores the complex interplay of environmental, behavioral, and socioeconomic factors that significantly influence global life expectancy. Using the WHO Global Health Observatory (GHO) dataset, we identified key determinants such as air pollution, water quality, smoking, alcohol consumption, and access to healthcare. While high-income countries generally benefit from longer life expectancies due to advanced healthcare systems and economic stability, substantial disparities persist both within and between nations.

A key lesson from this analysis is the importance of robust data preparation and cleaning. The complexity of the WHO GHO dataset, with its extensive coverage of countries, indicators, and dimensions, required significant effort to transform raw data into a usable format for exploratory analysis and visualization. Techniques such as missing value analysis, data filtering, merging and integration, reshaping, and aggregation were essential to streamline this process. Employing data visualization tools like ggplot2 further enhanced our ability to extract meaningful insights.

To examine country-specific trends, we developed an interactive D3.js visualization tool, enabling users to select countries of interest and perform time series analyses. However, certain factors—such as political instability, conflict, and historical events—play critical roles in shaping life expectancy and may not be fully captured by the explored indicators. Political instability, for example, often disrupts healthcare systems, limiting access to essential services and medications. Armed conflicts further reduce life expectancy through casualties, injuries, and the displacement of populations into refugee camps with inadequate sanitation, nutrition, and medical care. These challenges frequently extend beyond the cessation of conflict, delaying recovery and rehabilitation efforts. Cultural and social factors, including early marriages, female genital mutilation, gender inequality, and limited access to education, also adversely affect health outcomes, particularly for women and children. These issues reduce awareness of essential health practices and further restrict access to healthcare, exacerbating disparities.

Therefore, future research should focus on addressing gaps and uncovering new insights to better understand global health disparities. Integrating additional data sources, such as conflict databases, governance indicators, and cultural surveys, can provide a more nuanced view of country-specific factors. Longitudinal studies spanning decades may help identify long-term impacts of wars, pandemics, and policy shifts on life expectancy. Advanced machine learning models can uncover hidden relationships among determinants and forecast trends, while localized analyses of urban and rural disparities can illuminate critical gaps masked by national averages. Policy simulations assessing interventions—such as improving healthcare access, reducing air pollution, or increasing education levels—can guide effective strategies.
