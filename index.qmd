# Introduction

Global health stands at the intersection of humanity’s most pressing challenges and transformative opportunities, making it a topic of universal importance. Health transcends borders, cultures, and socioeconomic statuses, serving as the foundation of well-being, productivity, and equity. This project is driven by a deep recognition of the interconnectedness of global health systems and their profound impacts on individuals, communities, and the sustainability of our planet. The analysis focuses on identifying factors influencing life expectancy across 198 countries, territories, and areas. Specifically, it explores whether environmental factors, such as air pollution and water quality, or personal behaviors, such as being overweight, drinking, and smoking, significantly affect average life expectancy. Additionally, the analysis examines the roles of economic conditions, healthcare systems, and the availability of medical professionals, as well as unexpected factors such as suicide and traffic accidents, in shaping a country’s overall life expectancy. This exploration seeks to uncover key determinants of health and highlight areas for improvement to promote global well-being.
