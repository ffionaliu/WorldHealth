    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nGlobal health stands at the intersection of humanity’s most pressing challenges and transformative opportunities, making it a topic of universal importance. Health transcends borders, cultures, and socioeconomic statuses, serving as the foundation of well-being, productivity, and equity. This project is driven by a deep recognition of the interconnectedness of global health systems and their profound impacts on individuals, communities, and the sustainability of our planet. The analysis focuses on identifying factors influencing life expectancy across 198 countries, territories, and areas. Specifically, it explores whether environmental factors, such as air pollution and water quality, or personal behaviors, such as being overweight, drinking, and smoking, significantly affect average life expectancy. Additionally, the analysis examines the roles of economic conditions, healthcare systems, and the availability of medical professionals, as well as unexpected factors such as suicide and traffic accidents, in shaping a country’s overall life expectancy. This exploration seeks to uncover key determinants of health and highlight areas for improvement to promote global well-being.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe dataset selected for this project is the WHO Global Health Observatory (GHO) dataset, which provides comprehensive health-related statistics across 198 countries, territories, and areas. The data, sourced from the GHO portal API, is updated annually, with the latest extraction in September 2024. This dataset includes 138 indicators spanning various health domains, including alcohol use, environmental health, healthcare systems, life expectancy, and noncommunicable diseases. It also incorporates dimensions of inequality, such as age, economic status, household composition, place of residence, and sex, enabling detailed equity-focused analyses.\nThe dataset is provided in .xlsx format, with columns representing variables and rows corresponding to observations. Key variables include setting, denoting the geographic region or country; date, indicating the year of observation; and indicator_abbr and indicator_name, which identify and describe the health indicators. Other critical variables include estimate, representing the indicator’s value; ci_lb and ci_ub, providing the lower and upper bounds of the confidence intervals; and setting_average, summarizing average values within settings. Additional variables, such as favourable_indicator, indicator_scale, and ordered_dimension, assist in interpreting indicator data. Variables like whoreg6 and wbincome2024 categorize countries by WHO region and World Bank income classification, respectively.\nThe dataset’s diverse variables and structured format enable a wide range of analyses, from tracking global trends to exploring the impact of environmental, personal, and socioeconomic factors on life expectancy. Its compatibility with analytical tools like R ensures that the data can be readily processed, explored, and visualized. These attributes make the GHO dataset a robust resource for studying global health patterns and identifying determinants of life expectancy across diverse contexts.",

    "text": "2.2 Missing value analysis\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(naniar)\n\ndata &lt;- read_excel(\"/Users/maliwang/Desktop/Course/stat5702/rep_gho/data.xlsx\")\nvis_miss(data, warn_large_data = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe analysis of missing data in the dataset reveals several important patterns that guide its usability for further analysis. Notably, three columns se, population, and flag are entirely missing, providing no usable information. These columns are strong candidates for removal unless their absence can be explained or they are deemed relevant for specific indicators.\nOther columns, such as estimate, ci_lb, and ci_ub, exhibit partial missingness, with approximately 1% to 11% of their values missing. These columns are integral to quantitative analyses and will require careful handling, either through imputation techniques or exclusion of incomplete records, depending on their importance and the extent of missingness in the analysis context.\nKey columns, including setting, date, indicator_abbr, and indicator_name, are fully populated with 0% missing values, ensuring their reliability for supporting robust analyses. Furthermore, columns such as iso3, wbincome2024, and whoreg6 have minimal missing values, with less than 2% of their entries incomplete. This level of missingness poses no significant challenges to the analysis and is unlikely to bias results.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(stringr)\n\nmissing_summary &lt;- data |&gt;\n  group_by(indicator_name) |&gt;\n  summarise(MissingPercent = mean(is.na(estimate)), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  filter(MissingPercent &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(MissingPercent)) \n\n# Create a bar plot\nggplot(missing_summary, aes(x = reorder(indicator_name, MissingPercent), y = MissingPercent)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  coord_flip() +  # Flip the coordinates for better readability\n  labs(\n    x = \"Indicator Abbreviation\",\n    y = \"Missing Percentage\",\n    title = \"Missing Percentage by Indicator Name (Filtered)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8))+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe analysis above focused on how missing values in the estimate column are distributed across different indicators, as indicators with excessive missingness cannot be reliably used for analysis. The visualization of missing data highlights notable patterns across indicators with non-zero proportions of missingness in the estimate column. A thematic review reveals that indicators related to alcohol and tobacco use, as well as accessibility to assistive products, account for the majority of the missing data. Behavioral health indicators, such as smoking and e-cigarette use, often rely on specific surveys or self-reported data, which may not be systematically collected or consistently available across all regions. The significant absence of critical behavioral health indicators, particularly those pertaining to alcohol and tobacco use, poses a challenge to effective monitoring and intervention, limiting the ability to address associated health risks on a global scale.",

The x-axis represents various types of services, including basic and managed drinking water and sanitation, handwashing facilities, and open defecation rates. In the top 9 countries with the highest life expectancy, the population overwhelmingly relies on basic and managed services, with over 75% accessibility in most categories. Handwashing facilities are similarly widespread. However, in the bottom 9 countries, usage rates for managed services plummet, particularly for sanitation and drinking water. Open defecation, almost non-existent in high-life-expectancy nations, surges to around 20% in low-life-expectancy regions. These stark contrasts highlight the essential role of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services in promoting public health and improving life expectancy, underscoring the critical need for infrastructure investments in underserved areas.",

The High income group demonstrates the highest median life expectancy, slightly above 80 years, with a relatively narrow interquartile range (IQR), indicating low variability among countries in this category. A few outliers below 70 years suggest that some high-income countries experience lower-than-expected life expectancy. The Upper middle income group shows a median life expectancy of approximately 75 years, with a moderately wider IQR compared to the High income group, highlighting greater variability. The Lower middle income group exhibits a further decline in median life expectancy to around 70 years, accompanied by a wider IQR, suggesting even greater disparities within this category. The Low income group has the lowest median life expectancy, just above 60 years, with a wide range of variability and several outliers extending toward higher values, reflecting countries that outperform the average for this income group. This visualization underscores the strong positive correlation between national income levels and life expectancy while also highlighting the disparities and exceptions within each income category.\n\n\nCode\n# Identify Top 20 and Bottom 20 countries by average life expectancy\ntop_bottom_countries &lt;- country_avg_life_expectancy %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(average_life_expectancy)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(rank = row_number()) %&gt;%\n  mutate(category = case_when(\n    rank &lt;= 20 ~ \"Top 20\",\n    rank &gt; n() - 20 ~ \"Bottom 20\",\n    TRUE ~ NA_character_\n  )) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(category)) %&gt;%  # Keep only Top 20 and Bottom 20 countries\n  mutate(category = factor(category, levels = c(\"Top 20\", \"Bottom 20\")))\n\n# Plot the faceted bar chart\nggplot(top_bottom_countries, aes(x = reorder(setting, -average_life_expectancy), y = average_life_expectancy, fill = wbincome2024)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d()+\n  facet_wrap(~ category, scales = \"free_x\") +  # Ensure separate x-scales but fixed y-axis\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average Life Expectancy: Top 20 and Bottom 20 Countries\",\n    x = \"Country\",\n    y = \"Average Life Expectancy (Years)\",\n    fill = \"Income Group\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    strip.text = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    panel.spacing = unit(1, \"lines\")  # Increase spacing between facets for clarity\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Top 20 countries, all are classified as High income, demonstrate a direct correlation between economic prosperity and health outcomes. High life expectancy in these countries, consistently above 80 years, reflects advanced healthcare systems, widespread access to preventive care, high educational attainment, and robust public health infrastructure. These nations also benefit from lower rates of preventable diseases, effective management of chronic conditions, and social safety nets that support healthy aging. However, the clustering of high-income countries in this category raises questions about how lower-income nations can bridge this gap, particularly given the evident association between wealth and life expectancy.\nThe Bottom 20 countries, on the other hand, expose stark disparities. This group includes nations from Low income and Lower middle income categories, with a single representation from the Upper middle income group. Average life expectancy in this group, ranging from 50 to 60 years, is significantly lower than in the Top 20, reflecting the profound influence of socioeconomic factors on health. Challenges such as limited access to healthcare, high rates of infectious diseases, poor sanitation, malnutrition, and insufficient public health investment are likely contributors to these lower outcomes. For example, countries like Lesotho face a unique combination of socioeconomic and health crises, including high rates of HIV/AIDS, which dramatically reduce life expectancy.\nThe solitary representation of an Upper middle income country in the Bottom 20 warrants special attention. It suggests that income classification alone does not fully explain disparities in life expectancy. Factors such as political instability, corruption, uneven distribution of wealth, or regional health crises could account for this anomaly, indicating the need to go beyond income classifications to fully understand disparities in global health outcomes.",

In the first plot, a strong positive correlation is observed between the number of doctors and life expectancy at lower doctor-to-population ratios. For countries with fewer than 10 doctors per 10,000 people, life expectancy increases sharply as the availability of doctors rises, reflecting the critical role of medical practitioners in addressing basic healthcare needs and reducing preventable deaths. However, the relationship begins to plateau beyond approximately 20 doctors per 10,000, suggesting diminishing returns in higher-resource settings where additional doctors have a minimal incremental effect on already high life expectancy. The second plot reveals a similar pattern for nursing and midwifery personnel. Countries with low numbers of nursing and midwifery staff exhibit substantial increases in life expectancy as their numbers grow, emphasizing the importance of these personnel in maternal and general healthcare delivery. As with doctors, the relationship flattens at higher ratios, likely due to the saturation of healthcare systems where basic medical needs are already met. These findings underscore the critical role of healthcare personnel in improving life expectancy in underserved regions while highlighting the limits of their impact in more developed settings",

In the first graph, male suicide rates consistently exceed female rates across all income levels, with the gap being particularly pronounced in high-income and upper-middle-income countries. This suggests that while higher-income countries may have better access to mental health resources, societal pressures and mental health challenges disproportionately affect men. In lower-income countries, the disparity narrows slightly, though male rates still dominate, reflecting underlying cultural, societal, and economic factors. The second graph demonstrates a similar pattern for homicide rates, with male rates significantly exceeding female rates in all income groups. This disparity is most severe in upper-middle-income countries, where male homicide rates frequently surpass 60 to 90 per 100,000, likely due to higher levels of systemic violence, instability, and limited law enforcement. However, despite these patterns, the overall mortality due to suicide and homicide is relatively small compared to other causes of death and thus contributes minimally to the observed differences in life expectancy across income groups. This suggests that while suicide and homicide reflect important societal challenges, their direct impact on life expectancy is limited relative to broader health and systemic factors.",

Each line represents a country, with values normalized to a scale between 0 and 1 for comparability across indicators. The colors distinguish countries based on their income group.\nCountries in the High income group (darker lines) often show higher values for child obesity, adult BMI and insufficient physical activity, reflecting lifestyle patterns such as sedentary behavior and high-calorie diets that are more prevalent in wealthier nations. Despite this, these countries maintain relatively high life expectancy, likely due to advanced healthcare systems that manage chronic conditions effectively. In contrast, Low income countries (lighter lines) generally have higher rates of raised blood pressure and child obesity along with lower life expectancy, which may be attributed to limited access to healthcare, poor nutrition, and higher prevalence of untreated health conditions.",

Alcohol consumption shows a slight decline, especially after 2010, while life expectancy exhibits a steady upward trend, suggesting overall health improvements. The trends hint at a complex relationship: while alcohol intake slightly decreased, life expectancy’s growth slowed around the same period. This suggests that other factors, beyond alcohol consumption alone, may also shape life expectancy trends.\n\n\nCode\nAlcohol_country&lt;- Daily_intake |&gt;\n  group_by(setting) |&gt;\n  summarise(alcohol_intake = mean(mean(estimate, na.rm = TRUE)))\nAlcohol &lt;- merge(Alcohol_country,Avg_life_expectancy, by=\"setting\")\nggplot(Alcohol, aes(x = alcohol_intake, y = Average_life_expectancy)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +  # Scatter points\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = TRUE) + \n  scale_fill_viridis_d()+# Linear trend line\n  labs(title = \"Average Life Expectancy and Alcohol Consumption By Countries\",\n       x = \"Alcohol Consumption\",\n       y = \"Life Expectancy\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size=12) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5), # Center-align title\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5), # Center-align subtitle\n    legend.title = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther examining the connection between alcohol and life expectancy, the dot plot highlights a nonlinear relationship across 182 countries. Life expectancy increases with moderate alcohol consumption, peaking around 20 grams daily. Beyond this level, it plateaus and then declines as alcohol consumption rises. Notably, the variability in life expectancy at both very low and very high levels of alcohol consumption suggests that additional factors, such as socioeconomic conditions or health policies, may contribute to the observed trends. Moderate consumption appears to associate with slightly higher life expectancy, while excessive drinking clearly correlates with reduced longevity.\n\n\nCode\ncigarette_date &lt;- data |&gt;\n  filter(indicator_name == \"Estimate of current cigarette smoking prevalence (%)\") |&gt;\n  group_by(date) |&gt;\n  summarise(cigarette_prevalence = mean(mean(estimate, na.rm = TRUE)))\ntobacco_use_date &lt;- data |&gt;\n  filter(indicator_name == \"Estimate of current tobacco use prevalence (%)\") |&gt;\n  group_by(date) |&gt;\n  summarise(tobacco_use_prevalence = mean(mean(estimate, na.rm = TRUE)))\nSmoking_date &lt;- merge(tobacco_use_date,cigarette_date,by =\"date\")\nlife_smoke_date &lt;- merge(Smoking_date,life_expectancy_date,by=\"date\") \n\nsmoke_date &lt;- life_smoke_date |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(tobacco_use_prevalence, cigarette_prevalence),names_to = \"types\",values_to = \"value\")\n\nggplot(life_smoke_date) +\n  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = Average_life_expectancy, color = \"Life Expectancy\"), size = 1) +\n  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = tobacco_use_prevalence, color = \"Tobacco Use Prevalence\"), size = 1) +\n  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = cigarette_prevalence, color = \"Cigarette Prevalence\"), size = 1) +\n  scale_color_viridis_d() +\n  labs(title = \"Average Life Expectancy and Smoke Prevalence\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Value\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size=12) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5), # Center-align title\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5), # Center-align subtitle\n    legend.title = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShifting focus to smoking prevalence, another multiple time series graph highlights trends in life expectancy and cigarette use and tobacco use prevalence from 2000 to 2020. Life expectancy consistently increases, albeit with a slight plateau around 2019-2020, whereas cigarette and tobacco use prevalence steadily declines. This inverse relationship suggests that decreasing cigarette and tobacco use prevalence, likely driven by public health campaigns and regulatory measures, may contribute to longer lifespans.\n\n\nCode\ncigarette_country &lt;- data |&gt;\n  filter(indicator_name == \"Estimate of current cigarette smoking prevalence (%)\") |&gt;\n  group_by(setting) |&gt;\n  summarise(cigarette_prevalence = mean(mean(estimate, na.rm = TRUE)))\ntobacco_use_country &lt;- data |&gt;\n  filter(indicator_name == \"Estimate of current tobacco use prevalence (%)\") |&gt;\n  group_by(setting) |&gt;\n  summarise(tobacco_use_prevalence = mean(mean(estimate, na.rm = TRUE)))\n\nSmoking_country &lt;- merge(tobacco_use_country,cigarette_country,by =\"setting\")\nlife_smoke_country &lt;- merge(Smoking_country,Avg_life_expectancy,by=\"setting\") \nsmoke_country &lt;- life_smoke_country |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(tobacco_use_prevalence, cigarette_prevalence),names_to = \"types\",values_to = \"value\")\nggplot(smoke_country, aes(x = value, y = Average_life_expectancy)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +  # Scatter points\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = TRUE) + \n  scale_fill_viridis_d()+# Linear trend line\n  labs(title = \"Life Expectancy and Smoking Prevalence By Countries\",\n       x = \"Smoking Prevalence\",\n       y = \"Life Expectancy\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size=12) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5), # Center-align title\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5), # Center-align subtitle\n    legend.title = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dot plot examining smoking prevalence and life expectancy reveals a nuanced pattern. Initially, life expectancy rises with smoking prevalence up to around 20-25%, potentially reflecting better healthcare and socioeconomic conditions in moderately smoking populations. However, beyond this point, higher smoking prevalence leads to a clear decline in life expectancy, emphasizing the negative health impacts of smoking. This trend illustrates how, while moderate smoking prevalence might mask its adverse effects in certain contexts, high smoking rates unequivocally shorten lifespans.",

In the first graph, male suicide rates consistently exceed female rates across all income levels, with the gap being particularly pronounced in high-income and upper-middle-income countries. This suggests that while higher-income countries may have better access to mental health resources, societal pressures and mental health challenges disproportionately affect men. In lower-income countries, the disparity narrows slightly, though male rates still dominate, reflecting underlying cultural, societal, and economic factors. The second graph demonstrates a similar pattern for homicide rates, with male rates significantly exceeding female rates in all income groups. This disparity is most severe in upper-middle-income countries, where male homicide rates frequently surpass 60 to 90 per 100,000, likely due to higher levels of systemic violence, instability, and limited law enforcement. However, despite these patterns, the overall mortality due to suicide and homicide is relatively small compared to other causes of death and thus contributes minimally to the observed differences in life expectancy across income groups. This suggests that while suicide and homicide reflect important societal challenges, their direct impact on life expectancy is limited relative to broader health and systemic factors.",

Variables highly correlated with PC1 have the strongest influence on the overall variation. PC2 (14.4% explained variance) accounts for a smaller portion of the variation but captures the second most significant pattern in the data. Variables such as ambient rate, tobacco use prevalence, and cigarette prevalence are positively correlated and point in the same direction, indicating that they are strongly related. Similarly, basic drinking, basic sanitation services, managed drinking, and handwashing facilities are positively correlated and also cluster together, suggesting a shared influence. Key contributors to PC1 include household rate, ambient rate, and tobacco use prevalence, which have strong impacts on overall variation. For PC2, variables like managed drinking and managed sanitation contribute positively, representing the second major pattern in the data. When it comes to life expectancy, variables such as managed sanitation services, managed drinking services, and basic sanitation services have positive influences, indicating that improvements in water and sanitation infrastructure are associated with substantial gains in life expectancy. Conversely, variables like average blood pressure,air pollution (both household and ambient), open defecation, alcohol intake and smoking have negative influences, suggesting these factors are detrimental to health and longevity. The clustering of managed sanitation, managed drinking, and basic sanitation near Average Life Expectancy further emphasizes the critical role of health infrastructure in improving life expectancy outcomes.",

    "text": "This analysis delves into the intricate interplay of environmental, behavioral, and socioeconomic factors that significantly influence life expectancy across the globe. By leveraging the WHO Global Health Observatory (GHO) dataset, we observed that air pollution, water quality, smoking, alcohol consumption, and access to healthcare are key determinants of health outcomes. While high-income countries generally enjoy longer life expectancies due to advanced healthcare systems and economic prosperity, disparities persist within and between countries. To gain deeper insights into country-specific trends, we developed an interactive D3.js visualization tool that allows users to select specific countries of interest and conduct time series analyses. However, it’s important to note that country-specific factors, such as political instability, conflict, and historical events, can significantly influence health outcomes and life expectancy, and may not be fully captured by the factors explored in this analysis. Further research is needed to identify and understand these additional factors and their impact on global health disparities. A key lesson learned from this analysis is the critical importance of robust data preparation and cleaning. The complexity of the WHO Global Health Observatory (GHO) dataset, with its numerous countries, indicators, and dimensions, highlighted the significant time and effort required to transform raw data into a usable format for exploratory data analysis and visualization. This experience underscores the need for efficient data management techniques and tools, such as missing value analysis, data filtering, merging and joining for integration, data reshaping and aggregation for analysis, and data visualization libraries (e.g., ggplot2) for insights. By effectively utilizing these tools and techniques, researchers can streamline the data preparation process, accelerate analysis, and generate more accurate and reliable findings.",
