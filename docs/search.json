    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe data we chose is related to the topic of world health posted on the website of World Health Organization. The topic of world health captivates us because it sits at the crossroads of humanity’s greatest challenges and opportunities. Health is a universal concern that transcends borders, cultures, and socioeconomic statuses. It is the foundation of well-being, productivity, and equity. Our interest stems from a deep appreciation for the interconnectedness of global health systems and their profound impact on individual lives, communities, and the sustainability of our planet. Our project would focus on the field of disease, healthcare, and others to analyze the life expectancy of 198 countries, territories, or areas are related to which factors. For each specific field, we are going to use data to analyze does the environmental factors, such as air pollution and water condition, or personal factors, such as being overweight, drinking, and smoking, affect a country’s the average life expectancy; does a country’s economic situation, medical system, and the level of medical doctors and nursing staff affect the overall life expectancy; or does other unexpected factors, such as suicide and traffic accident, have significant influence on a country’s life expectancy.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe dataset selected for this project is the WHO Global Health Observatory (GHO) dataset, which provides comprehensive health-related statistics across 198 countries, territories, and areas. The data, sourced from the GHO portal API, is updated annually, with the latest extraction in September 2024. This dataset includes 138 indicators spanning various health domains, including alcohol use, environmental health, healthcare systems, life expectancy, and noncommunicable diseases. It also incorporates dimensions of inequality, such as age, economic status, household composition, place of residence, and sex, enabling detailed equity-focused analyses.\nThe dataset is provided in .xlsx format, with columns representing variables and rows corresponding to observations. Key variables include setting, denoting the geographic region or country; date, indicating the year of observation; and indicator_abbr and indicator_name, which identify and describe the health indicators. Other critical variables include estimate, representing the indicator’s value; ci_lb and ci_ub, providing the lower and upper bounds of the confidence intervals; and setting_average, summarizing average values within settings. Additional variables, such as favourable_indicator, indicator_scale, and ordered_dimension, assist in interpreting indicator data. Variables like whoreg6 and wbincome2024 categorize countries by WHO region and World Bank income classification, respectively.\nThe dataset’s diverse variables and structured format enable a wide range of analyses, from tracking global trends to exploring the impact of environmental, personal, and socioeconomic factors on life expectancy. Its compatibility with analytical tools like R ensures that the data can be readily processed, explored, and visualized. These attributes make the GHO dataset a robust resource for studying global health patterns and identifying determinants of life expectancy across diverse contexts.",

    "text": "2.2 Missing value analysis\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(naniar)\n\ndata &lt;- read_excel(\"/Users/maliwang/Desktop/Course/stat5702/rep_gho/data.xlsx\")\nvis_miss(data, warn_large_data = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe analysis of missing data in the dataset reveals several important patterns that guide its usability for further analysis. Notably, three columns se, population, and flag are entirely missing, providing no usable information. These columns are strong candidates for removal unless their absence can be explained or they are deemed relevant for specific indicators.\nOther columns, such as estimate, ci_lb, and ci_ub, exhibit partial missingness, with approximately 1% to 11% of their values missing. These columns are integral to quantitative analyses and will require careful handling, either through imputation techniques or exclusion of incomplete records, depending on their importance and the extent of missingness in the analysis context.\nKey columns, including setting, date, indicator_abbr, and indicator_name, are fully populated with 0% missing values, ensuring their reliability for supporting robust analyses. Furthermore, columns such as iso3, wbincome2024, and whoreg6 have minimal missing values, with less than 2% of their entries incomplete. This level of missingness poses no significant challenges to the analysis and is unlikely to bias results.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(stringr)\n\nmissing_summary &lt;- data |&gt;\n  group_by(indicator_name) |&gt;\n  summarise(MissingPercent = mean(is.na(estimate)), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  filter(MissingPercent &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(MissingPercent)) \n\n# Create a bar plot\nggplot(missing_summary, aes(x = reorder(indicator_name, MissingPercent), y = MissingPercent)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  coord_flip() +  # Flip the coordinates for better readability\n  labs(\n    x = \"Indicator Abbreviation\",\n    y = \"Missing Percentage\",\n    title = \"Missing Percentage by Indicator Name (Filtered)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8))+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe analysis above focused on how missing values in the estimate column are distributed across different indicators, as indicators with excessive missingness cannot be reliably used for analysis. The visualization of missing data highlights notable patterns across indicators with non-zero proportions of missingness in the estimate column. A thematic review reveals that indicators related to alcohol and tobacco use, as well as accessibility to assistive products, account for the majority of the missing data. Behavioral health indicators, such as smoking and e-cigarette use, often rely on specific surveys or self-reported data, which may not be systematically collected or consistently available across all regions. The significant absence of critical behavioral health indicators, particularly those pertaining to alcohol and tobacco use, poses a challenge to effective monitoring and intervention, limiting the ability to address associated health risks on a global scale.",
