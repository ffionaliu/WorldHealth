    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe data we chose is related to the topic of world health posted on the website of World Health Organization. The topic of world health captivates us because it sits at the crossroads of humanity’s greatest challenges and opportunities. Health is a universal concern that transcends borders, cultures, and socioeconomic statuses. It is the foundation of well-being, productivity, and equity. Our interest stems from a deep appreciation for the interconnectedness of global health systems and their profound impact on individual lives, communities, and the sustainability of our planet. Our project would focus on the field of disease, healthcare, and others to analyze the life expectancy of 198 countries, territories, or areas are related to which factors. For each specific field, we are going to use data to analyze does the environmental factors, such as air pollution and water condition, or personal factors, such as being overweight, drinking, and smoking, affect a country’s the average life expectancy; does a country’s economic situation, medical system, and the level of medical doctors and nursing staff affect the overall life expectancy; or does other unexpected factors, such as suicide and traffic accident, have significant influence on a country’s life expectancy.",
